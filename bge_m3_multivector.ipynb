    "# BGE-M3 Multi-Vector Hybrid Retrieval for RAG\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the **most advanced retrieval tutorial** in this series! This notebook demonstrates state-of-the-art multi-vector retrieval using **BGE-M3**, which combines three different retrieval methods in a single model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is BGE-M3?\n",
    "\n",
    "**BGE-M3** (released January 2024 by BAAI) is a breakthrough embedding model where **M3** stands for:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Multi-linguality**: Supports 100+ languages\n",
    "2. **Multi-granularities**: Handles up to 8,192 tokens\n",
    "3. **Multi-Functionality**: Unifies THREE retrieval methods in one model\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Three Retrieval Modes\n",
    "\n",
    "BGE-M3 can simultaneously perform:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. 🎯 Dense Retrieval\n",
    "- Traditional semantic embeddings (1024 dimensions)\n",
    "- One vector per document\n",
    "- Fast and good for semantic similarity\n",
    "- Uses [CLS] token from BERT\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. 🔍 Sparse Retrieval\n",
    "- Learned sparse vectors (like SPLADE)\n",
    "- Better than traditional BM25 (neural vs statistical)\n",
    "- Only non-zero weights for important terms\n",
    "- Vocabulary-sized with mostly zeros\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. 🧠 Multi-Vector (ColBERT)\n",
    "- Token-level late interaction\n",
    "- One vector per token in document\n",
    "- Highest quality but most expensive\n",
    "- Best used for reranking, not initial retrieval\n",
    "\n",
    "### IBM Research: Why This Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "IBM's 2024 **\"Blended RAG\"** paper demonstrated that:\n",
    "\n",
    "- ✅ **3-way retrieval is optimal** for RAG systems\n",
    "- ✅ Combining BM25 + dense + sparse achieved **NDCG@10 of 0.87** (8.2% improvement)\n",
    "- ✅ Adding ColBERT reranker yields **even better results**\n",
    "\n",
    "> *\"Three-way retrieval using all approaches is the optimal option for RAG\"* - IBM Research\n",
    "\n",
    "### What You'll Learn\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this notebook, you'll understand:\n",
    "\n",
    "- ✅ BGE-M3's three retrieval modes and when to use each\n",
    "- ✅ How ColBERT's late interaction works (token-level matching)\n",
    "- ✅ Multi-stage retrieval: candidates → reranking\n",
    "- ✅ How to combine methods with RRF (Reciprocal Rank Fusion)\n",
    "- ✅ Production architecture for optimal quality\n",
    "- ✅ Trade-offs: quality vs speed vs storage\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "- ✅ Milvus server running on `localhost:19530`\n",
    "- ✅ Python 3.8+\n",
    "- ✅ GPU recommended (but CPU works)\n",
    "- ✅ Basic understanding of embeddings and vector search\n",

    "**Pros:**\n",
    "- ⚡ Fast: Single vector comparison\n",
    "- 💾 Efficient storage: 1024 floats per document\n",
    "- 🎯 Good semantic understanding\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cons:**\n",
    "- ❌ Loses fine-grained token information\n",
    "- ❌ May miss exact keyword matches\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔍 Sparse Retrieval (Learned Lexical)\n",

    "- [ ] Enable query result cache for repeated queries\n",
    "- [ ] Set up replicas for high availability\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ Monitoring\n",
    "- [ ] Track latency percentiles (p50, p95, p99)\n",
    "- [ ] Monitor retrieval quality metrics (NDCG, MRR)\n",
    "- [ ] Log failed queries for analysis\n",
    "- [ ] Set up alerts for degraded performance\n",

    "# SECTION 11: Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "## What You Learned\n",
    "\n",
    "Congratulations! You've mastered state-of-the-art multi-vector retrieval with BGE-M3. Here's what you now understand:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🎯 Core Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **BGE-M3's Three Modes**:\n",
    "   - Dense retrieval (semantic, 1024-dim)\n",
    "   - Sparse retrieval (learned lexical, vocabulary-sized)\n",
    "   - ColBERT multi-vector (token-level late interaction)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Why Multi-Way Retrieval Works**:\n",
    "   - Dense captures semantics\n",
    "   - Sparse captures keywords\n",
    "   - ColBERT captures fine-grained token matching\n",
    "   - Combining all three achieves NDCG@10 of 0.87 (IBM research)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Two-Stage Architecture**:\n",
    "   - Stage 1: Fast candidate retrieval (Dense + Sparse)\n",
    "   - Stage 2: Expensive reranking (ColBERT)\n",
    "   - Balances quality and performance\n",
    "\n",
    "### 💡 Practical Insights\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Storage Strategy**:\n",
    "   - ✅ DO: Store dense + sparse vectors (~5 KB per doc)\n",
    "   - ❌ DON'T: Store ColBERT vectors (400 KB per doc)\n",
    "   - ✅ DO: Compute ColBERT on-the-fly for reranking\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **RRF (Reciprocal Rank Fusion)**:\n",
    "   - Elegant way to combine multiple retrieval methods\n",
    "   - Formula: `score = sum(1 / (k + rank_i))`\n",
    "   - Works better than score normalization\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **ColBERT Late Interaction (MaxSim)**:\n",
    "   - For each query token, find max similarity across ALL doc tokens\n",
    "   - Average these max similarities\n",
    "   - Allows pre-computing document vectors\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📊 Performance Guidelines\n",
    "\n",
    "| Documents | Recommended Architecture | Expected Latency |\n",
    "|-----------|-------------------------|------------------|\n",
    "| < 100K | Hybrid + ColBERT | 200-300ms |\n",
    "| 100K - 1M | Hybrid only | 50-100ms |\n",
    "| > 1M | Hybrid with careful tuning | 100-200ms |\n",
