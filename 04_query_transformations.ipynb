    "# Query Transformations for Improved Retrieval in RAG Systems\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This code implements three query transformation techniques to enhance the retrieval process in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Query Rewriting\n",
    "2. Step-back Prompting\n",
    "3. Sub-query Decomposition\n",
    "\n",
    "Each technique aims to improve the relevance and comprehensiveness of retrieved information by modifying or expanding the original query.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "RAG systems often face challenges in retrieving the most relevant information, especially when dealing with complex or ambiguous queries. These query transformation techniques address this issue by reformulating queries to better match relevant documents or to retrieve more comprehensive information.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Components\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Query Rewriting: Reformulates queries to be more specific and detailed.\n",
    "2. Step-back Prompting: Generates broader queries for better context retrieval.\n",
    "3. Sub-query Decomposition: Breaks down complex queries into simpler sub-queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Method Details\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Query Rewriting\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Purpose**: To make queries more specific and detailed, improving the likelihood of retrieving relevant information.\n",
    "- **Implementation**:\n",
    "  - Uses a GPT-4 model with a custom prompt template.\n",
    "  - Takes the original query and reformulates it to be more specific and detailed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Step-back Prompting\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Purpose**: To generate broader, more general queries that can help retrieve relevant background information.\n",
    "- **Implementation**:\n",
    "  - Uses a GPT-4 model with a custom prompt template.\n",
    "  - Takes the original query and generates a more general \"step-back\" query.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Sub-query Decomposition\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Purpose**: To break down complex queries into simpler sub-queries for more comprehensive information retrieval.\n",
    "- **Implementation**:\n",
    "  - Uses a GPT-4 model with a custom prompt template.\n",
    "  - Decomposes the original query into 2-4 simpler sub-queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Benefits of these Approaches\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Improved Relevance**: Query rewriting helps in retrieving more specific and relevant information.\n",
    "2. **Better Context**: Step-back prompting allows for retrieval of broader context and background information.\n",
    "3. **Comprehensive Results**: Sub-query decomposition enables retrieval of information that covers different aspects of a complex query.\n",
    "4. **Flexibility**: Each technique can be used independently or in combination, depending on the specific use case.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Implementation Details\n",
    "\n",
    "- All techniques use OpenAI's GPT-4 model for query transformation.\n",
    "- Custom prompt templates are used to guide the model in generating appropriate transformations.\n",
    "- The code provides separate functions for each transformation technique, allowing for easy integration into existing RAG systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example Use Case\n",
    "\n",
    "The code demonstrates each technique using the example query:\n",
    "\"What are the impacts of climate change on the environment?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Query Rewriting** expands this to include specific aspects like temperature changes and biodiversity.\n",
    "- **Step-back Prompting** generalizes it to \"What are the general effects of climate change?\"\n",
    "- **Sub-query Decomposition** breaks it down into questions about biodiversity, oceans, weather patterns, and terrestrial environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "These query transformation techniques offer powerful ways to enhance the retrieval capabilities of RAG systems. By reformulating queries in various ways, they can significantly improve the relevance, context, and comprehensiveness of retrieved information. These methods are particularly valuable in domains where queries can be complex or multifaceted, such as scientific research, legal analysis, or comprehensive fact-finding tasks."

    "## LangChain Query Transformations\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Multi-Query Retrieval**\n",
    "- **Class**: `MultiQueryRetriever`\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Generates multiple variations of the user query from different perspectives\n",
    "- **Use Case**: Improves retrieval recall when queries are ambiguous or when single query can't cover complete information\n",
    "- **Implementation**: Automatically generates 3-5 alternative questions using LLM prompts\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Query Decomposition**\n",
    "- **Module**: Query Analysis techniques\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Breaks down complex queries into distinct sub-questions\n",
    "- **Use Case**: When user input contains multiple questions that need separate retrieval\n",
    "- **Implementation**: Uses LLM function-calling to generate multiple sub-queries\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Query Rewriting (Rewrite-Retrieve-Read)**\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Rewrites poorly phrased queries into better retrieval queries\n",
    "- **Use Case**: When original query is not optimal for embedding/retrieval\n",
    "- **Implementation**: Uses LLM to rephrase query before passing to retriever\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Step-Back Prompting**\n",
    "- **Module**: `StepBackRetriever` (if available) or custom implementation\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Generates abstract, higher-level \"step back\" questions\n",
    "- **Use Case**: When specifics of a question trip up search quality\n",
    "- **Implementation**: First generates broader question, then queries using both original and step-back\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. **HyDE (Hypothetical Document Embeddings)**\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Generates hypothetical answer/document first, then uses it for retrieval\n",
    "- **Use Case**: When query embeddings aren't similar to relevant document embeddings\n",
    "- **Implementation**: LLM generates hypothetical relevant document, uses that for similarity search\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. **Query Routing**\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Routes queries to appropriate data sources/indexes\n",
    "- **Use Case**: Multiple indexes exist and only subset is relevant for given query\n",
    "- **Implementation**: LLM classifies query and selects appropriate retriever(s)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. **Query Structuring / Self-Query Retrieval**\n",
    "- **Class**: `SelfQueryRetriever`\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Converts natural language to structured queries with metadata filters\n",
    "- **Use Case**: When documents have searchable/filterable attributes\n",
    "- **Implementation**: \n",
    "  - Separates semantic query from metadata filters\n",
    "  - Translates to vector store-specific filter syntax\n",
    "  - Supports text-to-SQL, text-to-Cypher conversions\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8. **Conversational Query Transformation**\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Transforms conversation history into standalone search query\n",
    "- **Use Case**: Multi-turn conversations where context from history is needed\n",
    "- **Implementation**: Combines current query with conversation history\n",
    "\n",
    "### 9. **Query Expansion**\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Adds related terms, synonyms, or paraphrases to query\n",
    "- **Use Case**: When index is sensitive to query phrasing\n",
    "- **Implementation**: Generates expanded versions to increase retrieval chances\n",
    "\n",
    "### 10. **Reciprocal Rank Fusion (with Multi-Query)**\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Reorders documents retrieved from multiple query variants\n",
    "- **Use Case**: Combining results from multiple sub-queries effectively\n",
    "- **Implementation**: Uses RRF algorithm to merge and rank results\n",

    "- **Implementation**: Wraps query engine with `TransformQueryEngine`\n",
    "- **Parameter**: `include_original` - whether to include original query\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Multi-Step Query Decomposition**\n",
    "- **Class**: `StepDecomposeQueryTransform` + `MultiStepQueryEngine`\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Sequentially decomposes complex query into sub-questions\n",
    "- **Use Case**: Complex queries requiring iterative refinement against single knowledge source\n",
    "- **How it works**:\n",
    "  - Transforms query → executes → retrieves response\n",
    "  - Uses response + previous context to generate follow-up\n",

    "- **Purpose**: Routes to appropriate query engine based on query\n",
    "- **Selectors Available**:\n",
    "  - `LLMSingleSelector` - selects one query engine\n",
    "  - `LLMMultiSelector` - selects multiple query engines\n",
    "  - `PydanticSingleSelector` - uses OpenAI function calling (single)\n",
    "  - `PydanticMultiSelector` - uses OpenAI function calling (multiple)\n",
    "- **Use Case**: Different query engines for different query types (summarization vs. semantic search)\n",

    "#### b. **RouterRetriever**\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Routes to appropriate retriever based on query\n",
    "- **Same selector types as RouterQueryEngine**\n",
    "- **Use Case**: Multiple retrieval strategies (vector, keyword, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### c. **RetrieverRouterQueryEngine** (deprecated → use ToolRetrieverRouterQueryEngine)\n",
